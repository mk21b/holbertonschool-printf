.TH _PRINTF 3 "Holberton School" "Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function produces output according to the format argument,
which is a character string composed of zero or more directives.
Each directive is introduced by the character %.
The arguments following the format argument are converted and printed
according to the corresponding conversion specifier in the format string.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
.TP
.B %c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B %s
The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type
(pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including)
a terminating null byte.
.TP
.B %d, %i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %%
A '%' is written. No argument is converted.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, _printf() returns the number of characters printed
(excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH NOTES
The _printf() function does not support flag characters, field width, precision,
or length modifiers. Unrecognized conversion specifiers will print the %
character followed by the specifier character.
A trailing % at the end of the format string will be ignored.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    int count;

    count = _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "World");
    _printf("Number: %d, Char: %c\n", 42, 'A');
    _printf("Percent: %%\n");
    _printf("Returned: %d characters\n", count);

    return (0);
}
